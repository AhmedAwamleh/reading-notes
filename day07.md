## Who is Roy Fielding?
American computer scientist, one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and 
## the originator of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style

## Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web,
being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. 
But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements.
You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.
## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern
